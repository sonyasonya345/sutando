# Codex CLI as the Sutando core

Sutando can use either Claude Code or Codex CLI as its persistent task
execution core. Claude remains the upgrade-safe default. To select Codex, add
this gitignored per-clone override:

```json
{
  "core": { "runtime": "codex" }
}
```

Save it as `sutando.config.local.json`, then run:

```bash
codex login status
bash src/agent/start-cli.sh --restart
```

The tracked `type=codex` config entry sets `CODEX_HOME=~/.codex`, deliberately
reusing the user's authenticated Codex installation rather than copying login
tokens into the Sutando workspace. A local config may replace
`core_config_dirs` to select another home; because arrays replace wholesale,
include every Claude/Codex entry you still need.

## Runtime behavior

`src/agent/start-cli.sh` is the only generic launch/restart entry point. It
resolves `core.runtime` and delegates to the matching implementation.

The Codex implementation:

- owns the same `sutando-core` tmux session used by the menu bar, health checks,
  and terminal attachment;
- validates `codex` availability and authentication before changing the live
  session;
- uses approval policy `never` and sandbox `danger-full-access`, matching the
  full local access required by the owner core;
- enables web search and makes the user's home directory available;
- honors `SUTANDO_CORE_MODEL`, `SUTANDO_CORE_WORKING_DIR`, and the more specific
  `SUTANDO_CODEX_WORKING_DIR`;
- runs a separate managed `sutando-core-watcher` tmux session that converts
  task-file events into queued Codex prompts, including exact task and result
  paths;
- runs the shared core supervisor so dashboard/runtime health signals continue
  to update when Codex is selected;
- restarts the core and notifier together, preventing duplicate task consumers.

For a one-command trial without changing config, use the invocation-scoped
override:

```bash
SUTANDO_CORE_RUNTIME=codex bash src/agent/start-cli.sh --restart
```

## Rollback

Set `core.runtime` back to `claude` (or remove the local override) and run:

```bash
bash src/agent/start-cli.sh --restart
```

Task and result files are runtime-neutral, so queued work survives the switch.

## Diagnostics

```bash
bash scripts/sutando-config.sh core-runtime
bash scripts/sutando-config.sh core-config-dir-value codex
codex login status
tmux -S /tmp/sutando-tmux.sock attach -t sutando-core
tmux -S /tmp/sutando-tmux.sock capture-pane -p -t sutando-core
```

If tmux is unavailable, the launcher can still open Codex directly, but
automatic file-bridge wakeups are disabled; install tmux for unattended use.
